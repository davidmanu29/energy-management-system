# Energy Management System

A robust energy management system built with ASP.NET leveraging a microservices architecture. Each service is containerized with Docker, ensuring modularity and scalability. The system features a real-time chat service powered by SignalR and uses RabbitMQ for inter-service communication, while the frontend is developed with Angular.

## Features

- **Microservices Architecture:** Decoupled services for improved scalability and maintainability.
- **Dockerized Deployment:** Each microservice runs in its own container.
- **Real-Time Chat:** Integrated SignalR enables live chat functionality.
- **Message Queues:** RabbitMQ handles asynchronous communication between services.
- **Modern Frontend:** Angular-based UI for a responsive and dynamic user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** ASP.NET (Core) with microservices
- **Frontend:** AngularJS
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Real-Time Communication:** SignalR
- **Message Broker:** RabbitMQ
